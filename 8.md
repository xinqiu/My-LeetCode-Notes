# 8. String to Integer (atoi)

## Intro

Implement atoi to convert a string to an integer.

#### Hint

Carefully consider all possible input cases. If you want a challenge, please do not see below and ask yourself what are the possible input cases.

#### Notes

It is intended for this problem to be specified vaguely (ie, no given input specs). You are responsible to gather all the input requirements up front.

#### Requirements for atoi

The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.

The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function.

If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed.

If no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned. If the correct value is out of the range of representable values, INT_MAX (2147483647) or INT_MIN (-2147483648) is returned.

## Think

如果不看Requirenments，一些边界问题还真处理不好。首先去除字符串开头的空格，接着判断是否存在正负号。另外，如果在字符串中间存在空格或其他字符，则停止转换，也就是说，从左到右转换连续的数字字符。最后一个容易被忽略的地方是数字的范围，int是-2147483648到2147483647。

## Solution

Python
 
```python
class Solution(object):
    def myAtoi(self, str):
        """
        :type str: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        neg = False
        while len(str) > 0 and str[0] == ' ':
            str = str[1:]
        if len(str) > 0 and (str[0] == '+' or str[0] == '-'):
            if str[0] == '-':
                neg = True
            str = str[1:]
        i = 0
        while i < len(str) and ord(str[i]) in range(48, 58):
            i += 1
        n = 0
        if i > 0:
            n = int(str[:i])
        if neg:
            n = -n
        return max(min(n,2147483647), -2147483648)
```
